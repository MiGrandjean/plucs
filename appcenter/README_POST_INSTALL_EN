<p>
  PLUCS has been successfully installed onto your server. You can start using
  the service right now.

  <ol>
    <li>
      Open the properties of your server and assign one or more XMPP domains
      which the server should be responsible for. You don't need this step
      if this is the first installation of PLUCS in your domain: the primary
      domain of your UCS system is already assigned.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow your users to use the service. In the properties of any user object
      you'll find additional properties "XMPP enabled" and an "XMPP domain"
      the user should belong to. Note that newly-created users will be enabled
      and assigned to the primary UCS domain. For already existing users, you have
      to manually perform this step.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optionally, you can qualify user groups to be "XMPP groups". This makes
      them appear in the so-called "roster" of the users' XMPP client.
    </li>
  </ol>
